- `/ckm-slides` — slide deck design.

### Component Discovery & Review (shadcn)

Use when building or auditing shadcn/ui components.

- `/shadcn-component-discovery` — find existing shadcn components across 1,500+ registry entries before writing custom code.
- `/shadcn-component-review` — audit custom components against shadcn design patterns.

### UI/UX Polish & Quality (impeccable)

Use when improving visual quality of existing UI. These are composable sub-skills from the `impeccable` package.

- `/impeccable` — load the full design language context; invoke before other impeccable sub-skills.
- `/audit` — full design audit with file:line output.
- `/critique` — honest design critique.

- `/typeset` — typography refinement.
- `/colorize` — color system improvements.
- `/layout` — spatial and grid corrections.
- `/animate` — add or improve motion design.
- `/adapt` — responsive/adaptive design fixes.
- `/bolder` — increase visual confidence/hierarchy.
- `/quieter` — reduce visual noise.
- `/clarify` — improve clarity and readability.
- `/delight` — add micro-interactions and detail.
- `/distill` — simplify and remove excess.
- `/optimize` — performance-aware visual optimization.
- `/overdrive` — push design to its limits.
- `/shape` — refine shapes, borders, radii.

### Design Taste Variants (taste-skill)

Use when you need an opinionated visual direction. Pick one per session.

- `/design-taste-frontend` — general high-end frontend taste (start here).
- `/high-end-visual-design` — premium, editorial-quality UI.
- `/minimalist-ui` — clean, reduced, minimal direction.
- `/industrial-brutalist-ui` — raw, bold, brutalist direction.
- `/redesign-existing-projects` — redesign workflow for existing code.

- `/full-output-enforcement` — force complete output (no truncation).
- `/gpt-taste` — ChatGPT-influenced UI taste (use only when matching that aesthetic).

### UI/UX Reference

Use when reviewing implementations against patterns and best practices.

- `/userinterface-wiki` — knowledge base covering animation, CSS, typography, UX patterns, icon usage (11 categories). Outputs file:line findings.

### Animation (GSAP)

This project does not use GSAP (see "Don't use GSAP" in AGENTS.md). Use these only if the owner brings it back.

- `/gsap-react` — useGSAP hook, React integration, cleanup patterns.

- `/gsap-timeline` — timelines, labels, callbacks.
- `/gsap-scrolltrigger` — scroll-driven animations.
- `/gsap-plugins` — MorphSVG, DrawSVG, SplitText, Flip, etc.
- `/gsap-utils` — clamp, mapRange, interpolate helpers.
- `/gsap-performance` — GPU-composited transforms, will-change, FPS optimization.
- `/gsap-frameworks` — Vue/Svelte integration (not needed here; kept for reference).

### Memory & Planning (claude-mem)

Use to maintain context across sessions and structure work.

- `/mem-search` — search stored session memory and observations.
- `/knowledge-agent` — build a knowledge base from the codebase.
- `/make-plan` — create structured implementation plans.
- `/do` — execute a plan step-by-step with memory tracking.
- `/smart-explore` — explore codebase with memory-aware context.
- `/timeline-report` — generate timeline of changes and decisions.
- `/claude-code-plugin-release` — release workflow for Claude Code plugins.

### Agent Orchestration (ruflo)

- `/swarm-orchestration` — deploy and coordinate multi-agent swarms.
- `/swarm-advanced` — advanced swarm patterns.
- `/v3-swarm-coordination` — v3 swarm protocol.
- `/v3-core-implementation` — core agent implementation patterns.
- `/v3-deep-integration` — deep system integration patterns.
- `/v3-memory-unification` — unified memory across agents.
- `/v3-performance-optimization` — agent performance tuning.
